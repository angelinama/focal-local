## User Story

Main:
My family and I have just moved to a new neighborhood where I donâ€™t know anyone. We are struggling to juggle the move, remote learning for the kids, and remote work for the adults. We need help from our new community as we cannot afford to hire a costly contractor to do multiple minor repairs throughout our new home.
-Secondary:
Due to COVID-19, many new residents have moved into the suburbs where I live. I would like to make myself available to help my new neighbors settle in.
